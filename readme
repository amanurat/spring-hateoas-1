Sample application using HATEOAS approach.

Application depicts:
- hypermedia support
- service versioning using VND
- XML/JSON content representation (any representation can be attached easily)
- server-side approach to testing of service API:
    test are written using mock MVC thus they are pretty slow.
    Normally such tests should be placed in separate package with integration/functional tests.
    However for demo purposes they have been placed here with code of the services
    instead of unit tests which would enable to achieve similar results with minor effort (with the usage of mocks).

Usage:
1) run.sh: script builds package and runs local server
2) deploy-war.sh: script deploys war package to Tomcat server (CATALINA_HOME variable must be set)
3) demo.sh: script sends sample requests to local server using different versions of services.
    All messages are exchanged using JSON.
    Note: local server (run.sh) must be up and running before running this script.
4) demo-xml.sh: script sends sample requests to local server using different versions of services.
    All messages are exchanged using XML.
    Note: local server (run.sh) must be up and running before running this script.
